# ðŸ§® Pipelined ZanPU

**Pipelined ZanPU** is a simple implementation of a classic five stage RISC pipeline CPU.

This project is the team project of BIT's 2019 summer CPU-building lecture. ZanPU's architecture shares the one mentioned in: [Classic RISC pipeline - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_RISC_pipeline).

## Usage

- Open Vivado
- Run sythesis, implementation
- Program board
- Profit.
